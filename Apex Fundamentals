wrapper - embed primitive types (Integer class instead of int,char) -heap not stack

primitive - Integer
referenced - memory allocated through constructer (Account acc = new Account())

Anon Window - As a transaction to Application server and returns a log file

3 types -

Singleton - Only 1 reference - no new keyword - constructor is a Private (String abc = new String() -- > not possible) 
"final" -- > no inheritance

1.primitive - objects - storing primitive value as wrapper - Auto boxing
2.referenced
3.collections


Super class - SObject - all standard and custom objects are child to SObject.
Process of moving the data from child to parent is UPCASTING - Implicit (no need to convert since sobject is super class) SObject = object.
Process of moving the data from parent to child is DOWNCASTING - Explict (need to convert ) SObject memory ---- account = (Account)SObject.
