Limitations of SOQL transactions :
 
 1.Number of SOQL statements fire in a transaction is 100.
 2.Number of records returned by all SOQL queries in a transaction is 50,000.
 3.Maximum Heap size for records stored in transaction is 6MB.
 
Best Practices:

 1.Never put SOQL query in the body of "for loop". -Very Important
 2.Always use SOQL Query with where clause for retrieving filter data
 3.Use indexed fields for filtering that fetches the data quickly.
 NOTE : cluster index - id non - cluster --- > unique fields.
 4.Always use ORDER BY clause at the end of the query for getting sequenstial output.
 5.Use LIMIT Keyword with Limits API for making your query getting data always within governer limits - vvvvvimportant
 LIMIT : (Limits.getLimitQueryRows - Limit.getQueryRows)  Synchronous transaction 50,000 / Async - 5 Million (sequence is not guarenteed)
 6.Always give preference to child to parent relationships (right join) for getting data from multiple objects.
 Cartesian result -- if subquery and inner query.
 7.use "For update" keyword in SOQL transactions to avoid deadlocks in bulk transactions -- two queries hit same resource deadlcok happens.
 8.Use Dynamic SOQL in the business logic methods that deal with UI.
 
FOR UPDATE -- > shared lock.
