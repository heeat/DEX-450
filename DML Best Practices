Governer Limits:
 1. Number of DML statements per transaction is 150.
 2. Number of records processed through Single DML Statement in a transaction is 20,000.
 3. Heap Size is 6MB.
 
Best Practices:

 1. Always use Bulkification in DML Statements -- Bulkify - > processing DML staments using Lists 
 2. Don't put DML in the body of for loop. -- > reason is  Governer Limits 
 3. Always use Exception handling along with DML.
 4. Use database methods for performing DML actions to achieve partial success or failure transactions.
 5. Use Nested "for loop" for handling DML Statements to consider heap size limitations of your transaction.
 
 Example : default batch size : 200 / 150*200 = 30,000 records can be processed with this code.
 ```
 for(List<Account> acclist : ['SOQL'])
{
    List<Account> uplist = new List<Account>();
    for(Account acc : acclist){
        acc.city = 'xyz';
        uplist.add(acc);
    }
    Database.upsert(uplist,false);
}
```
