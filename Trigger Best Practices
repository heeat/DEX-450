Best Practices:

 1. Implement 1 Object 1 Trigger Policy
 2. Use Trigger branching for executing business methods on different events.
 3. Never put business implementations in trigger and call apex methods for firing business rules that covers record level security.
 4. Use static variables in triggers for handling memory throughout the transaction aswell as controlling trigger recursions.
 5. Understand Trigger execution order to avoid conflicts between triggers and other automation tools.
 6. Use future annotated triggers for calling trigger execution through web services.
 7. Use debug logs and debug statements for understanding execution problems involving triggers in objects.

Trigger Execution Order :
1. Caching (milestone)

2. System validations
3. Before triggers
4. System validations (rerun)
5. Custom Validations - wont run in the second cycle
6. Duplicate Rules - wont run in the second cycle

7. Save (milestone)

8. After triggers
9. Assignment Rules
10. Auto Response rules
11. WorkFlow Rules
12. Process Builder
13. Sharing Rules
14. Roll Up Summary fields will be calculated
15. Escalation Rules

16. Commit (final Milestone)

17. Clean up OPS (Post commit ops)
