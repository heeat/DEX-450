Programming Automation in Apex:

1 OBJECT 1 TRIGGER POLICY. -- Traffic cop logic (line 15)

  1.Trigger - Apex Code built on SF that gets activated by events. - bound to an object
  two types : Before (After caching before Saving), After (After saving before Commiting).
  
  Events : Before Insert/Update/Delete 
           After Insert/Update/Delete/Undelete
           
 1.To implement a trigger -- > which object / what type of trigger / what events.
 
 Trigger API Class -- > Singleton/Final/Static - so we can use (Trigger.new) nomenclature.
 
 Variables :
 1. isInsert/Update/Delete/Undelete/Before/After
 2. Collections :
     .new (holds caching data of DML) -- R/W / old(holds existing records data which are in "new") -- readOnly
    ..newMap(Key:ID,Value:Object reference)/OldMap -- > After trigger because we need ID's
